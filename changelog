  * Changed the comment-stripping sed expression to insert a blank line
    after stripping out a comment, to avoid running together consecutive
    paragraphs.

  * Fmt needs different switches under Darwin than under Unix, and
    also needs a different approach to selectively format only the
    comments, not the quoted draft text.  Fixed.

  * sed under Darwin can't handle '\r' and '\t' in the regexp patterns, it
    seems.  Substituted literal tab and cr instead.  This feels fragile.

  * Given an input file with \r\n line endings, the sed regexp to remove comments
    to re-create the commentless draft would fail.  Fixed.

  * Changed default operation to expect only the review file, and generate the
    diff base by removing comments.  Removed code which handled the old operating
    mode which required one 'review-' file and one 'draft-' file.

  * Added error message and usage output when no filename is given.

  * Refined the usage message to not show the long options when run under Darwin,
    where getopt doesn't support long options.

  * Removed verbose option which didn't do anything

  * Fixed problem with argument parsing under Darwing : getopt's -o switch need
    the options immediately following the -o, without intervening space
  * Fixed difference between linux and Darwin sed: -r switch versus -E for extended
    regular expressions.
  * Added a missing '$' in the test for the --nodraft option.
  * Removed the use of a temporary file for the reviewed document
  * Fixed sed replacement patterns containing escape character codes to work under
    Darwin by replacing them with the actual characters.

  * Added version information
  * Added usage information
  * Added option parsing, and options --help --version --tag --nodraft
  * Added code to regenerate draft file from review file, to avoid
    the need to have both draft file and review file present
